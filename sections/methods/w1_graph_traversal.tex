\subsection{Graph Traversal Algorithms}

\textbf{Breadth-first search} (BFS) explores vertices level by level, employing a queue data structure. When a vertex is dequeued, its distance from the source is definitively established. The algorithm visits each vertex and edge exactly once, yielding $O(V + E)$ complexity.

\textbf{Depth-first search} (DFS) explores as deeply as possible before backtracking, utilising a stack (either explicit or via recursion). Upon completion of a vertex's processing, all reachable descendants have been visited. Complexity is likewise $O(V + E)$.

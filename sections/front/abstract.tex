This article presents a comparative study of fundamental algorithms across four families: sorting, string matching, graph traversal, and shortest path finding. We implement these algorithms in C++ and benchmark them against standard library implementations. Our results confirm theoretical complexity predictions while revealing practical performance characteristics. The unified abstraction developed for Dijkstra and A* demonstrates that algorithmic design patterns can yield both correctness and flexibility.

This article presents a comparative study of fundamental algorithms across five families: sorting, string matching, graph traversal, shortest path finding, and dynamic programming for NP-complete problems. We implement these algorithms in C++ and benchmark them against both standard library implementations and brute-force alternatives. For classical algorithms, results confirm theoretical complexity predictions while revealing practical performance characteristics. For NP-complete problems, we investigate the subset-sum and 0/1 knapsack problems, demonstrating the dramatic performance gap between exponential brute-force enumeration and pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solutions. Our experiments show that dynamic programming achieves speedups exceeding $10^5$ for moderate input sizes, empirically validating the theoretical distinction between $O(2^n)$ and $O(n \cdot W)$ complexities.

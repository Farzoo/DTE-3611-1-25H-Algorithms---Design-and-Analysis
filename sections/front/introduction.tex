\section{Introduction}

Algorithm analysis is fundamental to computer science, providing theoretical foundations for efficient problem-solving~\cite{book:clrs:2009}. This study examines four algorithm families: sorting, string matching, graph traversal, and shortest path computation.

Our implementations leverage the Boost Graph Library~\cite{online:bgl:2025} for graph representations, while the STL~\cite{book:plauger:2000} provides reference implementations. The objective is twofold: to validate theoretical complexity bounds through empirical measurement, and to identify which variants perform best under various conditions.

This article presents a comparative study of fundamental algorithms across five families: sorting, string matching, graph traversal, shortest path finding, and dynamic programming for NP-complete problems, together with a case study of network flow algorithms. We implement these algorithms in C++ and benchmark them against both standard library implementations and brute-force alternatives. For classical algorithms, results confirm theoretical complexity predictions while revealing practical performance characteristics. For NP-complete problems, we investigate the subset-sum and 0/1 knapsack problems, demonstrating the dramatic performance gap between exponential brute-force enumeration and pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solutions. Network flow experiments compare the Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm with a cycle-canceling minimum-cost variant, quantifying the substantial computational overhead of cost optimisation on sparse layered networks. Finally, we examine amortised analysis of dynamic data structures, comparing dictionary implementations and evaluating the performance impact of polymorphic memory resources. A theoretical discussion relates the shortest path problem to linear programming, demonstrating that Dijkstra's algorithm implicitly solves an LP formulation.
